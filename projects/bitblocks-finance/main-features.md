# Main Features

#### Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

BitBlocks Finance operates as a decentralized exchange, facilitating the direct exchange of tokens between users, eliminating the need for a centralized intermediary. This provides users with a higher level of security, privacy, and control during token transactions.

#### Yield Farming Protocol

Users can participate in yield farming on BitBlocks Finance, earning BBKFI tokens and other tokens by staking or providing liquidity to the protocol.

#### Burn Mechanisms

BitBlocks Finance has various burn mechanisms to constantly increase the price of the BBKFI token:

* Burn in COMMUNITY-FARMS in some cases
* Direct burn by users
* Burn through games present on the platform
* Burn through deflationary tokens

#### Security

The BitBlocks Finance platform prioritizes the security of users and funds. To ensure this, we have implemented measures such as:

* Timelock added to the contract at launch
* Code audit by Certik
* Full descentralized code
