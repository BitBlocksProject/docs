# üè≥ Voting System

#### Introduction to the Voting System

At BitBlocks Finance, we avoid making arbitrary changes. You, as a user, have the power to choose the next changes to the BBKFI project. To vote on new proposals, you need to have BBKFI in your wallet (it cannot be in a pool or farm). Your voting power is based on the amount of BBKFI you had in your wallet at the exact block of the snapshot.

#### Creating Proposals

Any user can create a change proposal for BBKFI using the website [https://snapshot.org/#/bitblocks.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/bitblocks.eth). For a proposal to be approved, there are some rules:

* Proposals must have at least 5% of the circulating coins in voting power
* There must be at least 10 different wallets voting
* The vote must last at least 1 week
* The snapshot must be taken at the time the proposal begins (or very close)

**What can be changed?**

* Add or remove tokens
* Proposal of new networks or changes to the protocol
* Use the funds from the marketing wallet ([https://bscscan.com/address/0x11eE751AEa6c860C26b1728bD5904d80C2a00177](https://bscscan.com/address/0x11eE751AEa6c860C26b1728bD5904d80C2a00177))
* And much more

#### Proposals Created by the Team (CORE PROPOSALS)

Proposals created by the BitBlocks team are special and do not need to follow the above-mentioned rules to be approved. These proposals appear when a change in BBKFI is necessary. The BBKFI team cannot vote on these proposals.

Examples of CORE proposals:
