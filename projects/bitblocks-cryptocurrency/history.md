\_**Dec 26, 2019 - Spam attack**

A spam attack occurred on the BitBlocks network, the attacker created several orphan blocks and sent them to a single node, causing the node to use a lot of CPU and RAM, knocking down the node and potentially causing a fork in the network. As transactions do not have a fee, the attacker could do this as many times as they wanted without paying anything. We discovered the error and launched a temporary updated version to avoid this spam of orphan blocks.\
