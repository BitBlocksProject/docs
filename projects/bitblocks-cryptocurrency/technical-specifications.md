#### 3.5 Masternodes and Requirements

To operate a masternode on the BitBlocks network, it is necessary to have a minimum balance of 150,000 BBK (BitBlocks) as collateral. This helps to ensure that masternode operators are committed to the project and have a personal interest in ensuring the security and efficiency of the network.

#### 3.6 Security and Decentralization

The combination of the PoS algorithm and the use of masternodes allows the BitBlocks network to operate in a decentralized and secure manner. As a result, the platform is more resistant to attacks and manipulations, ensuring the integrity of transactions and data stored on the blockchain.

#### 3.7 Speed and Scalability

BitBlocks was designed to handle a high volume of transactions per second (TPS) of approximately 346 TPS. This is possible thanks to the maximum block size of 2 MB and the estimated block time of 60 seconds. These characteristics allow the network to be scalable and capable of supporting an increasing number of transactions as the adoption of the cryptocurrency increases.

#### 3.8 Transaction Fees and Real-World Use

BitBlocks offers zero transaction fees, making it an attractive option for payments and digital transfers. This encourages widespread adoption of the cryptocurrency, as it allows users to save compared to other traditional or digital payment options. The speed of transactions is also an important factor, allowing for instant payments in an increasingly digital environment.

In summary, the BitBlocks cryptocurrency presents several features that make it an attractive option for investors, traders, and consumers. With its PoS consensus algorithm, masternodes, block rewards, security, decentralization, speed, and scalability, BitBlocks has the potential to become a widely used digital currency around the world.
