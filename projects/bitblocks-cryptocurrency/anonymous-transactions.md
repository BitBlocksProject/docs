# Anonymous Transactions

### 4. Anonymous Transactions

One of the distinct features of BitBlocks is the ability to perform anonymous transactions. This allows users to maintain their financial privacy, an important aspect in the digital world we live in today. BitBlocks uses a protocol similar to the one employed by DASH, its originating currency, to ensure the anonymity of transactions.

#### 4.1 Anonymity Protocol

The BitBlocks anonymity protocol is based on a CoinJoin implementation, a method used to make transactions more difficult to trace. This is done by combining several transactions into a single transaction, which makes it virtually impossible to link an input to a specific output. In this way, user privacy is preserved, ensuring that transactions are secure and anonymous.

#### 4.2 Benefits of Anonymous Transactions

The ability to perform anonymous transactions brings several benefits to BitBlocks users. Among them are:

* Privacy protection: By performing anonymous transactions, users can protect their financial and personal information from being exposed to malicious third parties or tracking by governments and financial institutions.
* Security: The anonymity of transactions helps protect users against targeted attacks and identity theft.
* Resistance to censorship: The ability to perform anonymous transactions makes BitBlocks resistant to censorship, allowing users to make payments and transfers even in countries with financial and political restrictions.
